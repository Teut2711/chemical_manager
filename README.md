Chemical Supplies Table Manager
Overview

This project provides an interactive table for managing a list of chemical supplies. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder rows representing different chemicals. The table supports undo/redo functionality, sorting by columns, and exporting the data to CSV. It is built using TypeScript, SCSS, and follows the BEM naming convention for styling.
Features

    Add Chemical Rows: Dynamically add new chemicals to the table.
    Edit Rows: Each cell in the table is editable; clicking a cell allows changes to be made.
    Row Selection: Rows can be selected using checkboxes, enabling batch actions.
    Reorder Rows: Move selected rows up or down in the table.
    Delete Rows: Delete selected rows from the table.
    Undo/Redo: Undo and redo actions for managing state changes.
    Sorting: Sort columns by ascending or descending order.
    CSV Export: Export the table data as a CSV file.
    Auto-Save: Table state is auto-saved every 5 seconds to prevent data loss.

The table contains the following columns:

    Index: Auto-incremented index of the chemical row.
